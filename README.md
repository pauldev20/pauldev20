<p align="center">Iâ€™m Paul. Since a young age, Iâ€™ve been interested in all kinds of electronic devices. I began by repairing and building tube amplifiers, moved into microcontrollers, and eventually progressed to software development. After studying "Industrial Engineering", I joined 42 Heilbronn, a project-based coding school, and completed the program and an internship by the end of 2024. Iâ€™m especially interested in blockchain (mainly Ethereum) and privacy-preserving software with a focus on full-stack engineering. I enjoy fast, MVP-driven iterations that grow into clean, user-friendly products, prioritizing what matters. Skilled in reverse engineering, energetic, and committed to continual learning. In my free time, I still tinker with hardware and music gear.</p>
