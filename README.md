<p align="center">Iâ€™m Paul. Since a young age, Iâ€™ve been interested in all kinds of electronic devices. My passion for music and playing guitar led me to develop and repair tube amplifiers. From there, I developed an interest in microcontrollers and IoT devices, which then pushed me toward software development. After my first studies in Industrial Engineering, I joined 42 School in March 2022, completing the â€˜coreâ€™ program and an internship by December 2024. During this time, I developed a strong interest in blockchain technology with a focus on Ethereum. In my free time, I work on a variety of projects, especially those related to hardware, automotive, and music.</p>
